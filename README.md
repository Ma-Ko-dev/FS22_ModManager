# FS22_ModManager
Simple ModManager for the Game "Farming Simulator 2022". 
<br><br>
Work in Progress. If you have any suggestions please leave a message in the issue section.
<br>
Minimum requirements are already done. It technically works if you know how to run Python.
<br><br>
For now, the bare bone ModManager can:
- Read a savegame's active mods
- Move all mods from the mod folder that are not in the savegame into a seperate folder.
